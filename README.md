# CRUD
Backed task CRUD application using flask for CodeChef VIT Vellore


Tried to add docker but wasn't able to properly do so
But i have still added the files related to it

The application uses Flask for backend, and SQLite for DataBase Management
I have also used pandas to allow user to import/export the files


Extra features of the app
1) Category based segrigation
2) Import and Export using Excell files
3) Filter search based on categories
4) Shows you when an item is low in quantity
